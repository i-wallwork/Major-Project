# Major-Project

### Project Aim
This project aims to produce Machine Learning models to analyse TCGA-HNSC data, ultimately to identify and rank proteins and their features, in accordance with how indicative they are of HNSCC development and progression. This research should contribute towards the fields of medical early detection and risk stratification by providing a base from which clinical biomarkers can be developed.
