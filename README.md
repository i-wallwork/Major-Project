# Major-Project

### Project Aim
This project aims to produce Machine Learning models to analyse TCGA-HNSC data, ultimately to identify and rank proteins and their features, in accordance with how indicative they are of HNSCC progression.

### Running code
Files need to be extracted from Dr. Paul Yousefi's data pipeline to access the TCGA-HNSC data and execute this code - https://github.com/yousefi138/tcga-hnsc. After extraction, these need to be upload into Colab, then the corresponding preprocessing needs to be executed. After this, the wanted FS technique can be applied and the subsequent selected features can be extracted for use in running a selected ML pipeline. Methods for performance metrics and feature importance extraction from these ML models are also found here.
